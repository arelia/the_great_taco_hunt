=========

This is a community-driven taco repo, inspired by [TacoFancy](http://github.com/sinker/tacofancy). Please fork and submit your own places, because that is awesome. 

Each city should be its own markdown document. If content warrents it, we can switch to states [or country] naming conventions.
    
Community assistance in growing the number of cities, or in better organizing or whatever is more more more than welcome.


notes on writing & naming conventions
-------------------------------------

* For ease, please write where to eat in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and give your files the .md extension.

* Please name your files with underscores_in_place_of_spaces so that links remain readable and aren't%20full%20of%20bullshit.

No better time than the present to learn Git!

* Perhaps others can contribute helpful Git 101 links & tips here.
